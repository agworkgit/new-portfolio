# Alex Grigore - React Portfolio

## Description
My motivation was to use my React and NPM skills to create a beautiful and detailed portfolio site.
This React-powered portfolio isn't just a showcase – it's my digital canvas where creativity meets innovation. Join me on a journey through sleek design, interactive elements, and a touch of my own personality.
